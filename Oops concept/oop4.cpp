/*

Data encapsulation is supported with “class”. The class consists of both data and functions. 
The data in a class is called a member, while functions in the class are called methods. 

Data Members:- 
The variables which are declared in any class by using any fundamental data types (like int, char, float, etc.) 
or derived data types (like class, structure, pointer, etc.) are known as Data Members.

Methods:- 
A method is the equivalent of a function in object-oriented programming that is used inside classes. 
The methods are the actions that perform operations. 
A method accepts parameters as arguments, manipulates these, and then produces an output when the method is called on an object. 

Constructor:- 
Constructors are special class functions that perform the initialization of every object. 
In C++, the constructor is automatically called when an object is created. 
It is a special method of the class because it does not have any return type. 
It has the same name as the class itself.
